  <summary>System and Hardware information tool</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
	I-Nex is an application that gathers information for hardware
	components available on your system and displays it using an
       	user interface similar to the popular Windows tool CPU-Z.
    </p>
    <p>
	I-Nex can display information for the following components:
	CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Sound, Hard disks, RAM, Network and USB as
	well as some system info like the hostname, Linux distribution and
       	version, Xorg, GCC, GLX versions and Linux Kernel info.
    </p>
    <p>
	Besides being able to display hardware information, I-Nex can also
	generate an advanced report for which you can select what to include
	and optionally send the report to a service such as Pastebin (and others).
	It also features an option to take a screenshot of the I-Nex window directly
       	from the application.
    </p>
    <p>
	The difference between I-Nex and the other hardware information GUI tools
	available for Linux is that the information is better organized and is
	displayed faster (than lshw-gtk for instance). Also, the hardware information
       	is presented in a way thatâ€™s easier to understand than other such tools.
    </p>
